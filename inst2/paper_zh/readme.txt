The pdf template of bookdown-paper_zh originated from a LaTeX template I collected somewhere during the early days of my learning LaTeX. I modified it as 'tex/template_paper_zh.tex'.

Here is a brief description for re-use:

- Install R and RStudio.
- Install R bookdown package and R bookdownplus package.
- Create a skeleton of the manuscript.
- Revise the .Rmd files as your own.
- Build the book.
