The pdf template of bookdown-mail originated from the LaTeX template [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv). I modified it as 'tex/template_mail.tex', i.e. the sender, the receiver, and their addresses information was moved from the original LaTeX template to the yaml of 'index.Rmd'.

Here is a brief description for re-use:

- Install R and RStudio.
- Install R bookdown package and R bookdownplus package.
- Create a skeleton of the manuscript.
- Revise the .Rmd files as your own.
- Build the book.
